      <blockquote>
              <p>Sergio Perez set the fastest time of the week by far in the final session of the Bahrain test. The Red Bull driver was followed by a Mercedes, an Alfa Romeo and a Ferrari.</p>

      <ul class="highlights">
        <li><strong>17:30</strong> The 2023 pre-season testing in Bahrain is over!</li>
        <li><strong>17:27</strong> The drivers are now engaged in start-up tests.</li>
        <li><strong>17:26</strong> As a result, Yuki Tsunoda found himself leading a semblance of a race, with PÃ©rez, Bottas and Norris battling behind him. The Finn then went into the inside of the Red Bull at Turn 8.</li>
        <li><strong>17:23</strong> Now takes place a formation lap</li>
        <li><strong>17:23</strong> Right away, seven cars go to the track.</li>
        <li><strong>17:22</strong> Green flag.</li>
        <li><strong>17:19</strong> As expected, there's a simulation of a red flag at the end of the session.</li>
        <li><strong>17:16</strong> Perez's Red Bull has flow-vis on its halo.</li>
        <li><strong>17:06</strong> Only 25 minutes left in these pre-season tests!</li>
        <li><strong>17:01</strong> It's only a 1'31"054.</li>
        <li><strong>16:59</strong> Bottas launches into a lap in new C5.</li>
        <li><strong>16:57</strong> The Mexican did not manage to do better than a 1'30"620, which is still faster than all the other drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>16:56</strong> Here we go again for a fast lap with Perez and he is three hundredths behind in the first sector...</li>
      </ul>
